# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Shopping List Items Project

This is a front-end project in React created by Vite Tool. Initially bootstrapped by Vite platform. Then changes are made and incremental commits are made.

This project contains features of adding & searching different shopping items from a list of shopping items or in other words shopping list. This will also focus on CRUD operation involving shopping items/shopping list as our resource/object of focus.

There will also be a separate backend functionality for this particular shopping-list items project created in Node/Express and MongoDB.
We will see if we could combine these two separate projects later on or not. This backend project will be also hosted on GitHub as well.

Else, may be a different full stack project (focusing on a different resource or object of our focus may be other than shopping-list items) will be hosted on GitHub combining both the backend and frontend in MERN stack later taking inspiration from this particular separate frontend project & backend project respectively.
